-- Step 6.7 - Write SQL statements that will process five non-routine requests for information from the database just created

--1. Find the names of all artists who were interviewed after January 1, 2014 but who have no works of art listed. 

SELECT firstName, lastName

WHERE interviewDate> '01-Jan-2014' AND NOT EXISTS	
	(SELECT *
	FROM	Artwork
	WHERE artistId =Artist.artistId);

--2.	Find the total commission for salesperson John Smith earned between the dates April 1, 2014 and April 15, 2015. Recall that the gallery charges 10% commission, and the salesperson receives one-half of that, which is 5% --of the selling price.

SELECT .05 * SUM(salePrice)
FROM Sale
WHERE saleDate>='01-Apr-2015'  AND saleDate<='15-Apr-2015' AND
	salespersonSSN = (SELECT socialSecurityNumber
					FROM Salesperson
					WHERE firstName= 'John' AND lastName ='Smith');

--3.	Find the collector names, artist names and titles of all artworks that are owned by collectors, not by the --artists themselves, in order by the collector’s last name.

SELECT Collector.firstName, Collector.lastName, Artist.firstName, Artist.lastName, workTitle
FROM Artist, Artwork, Collector
WHERE Artist.artistId = Artwork.artistId AND Artwork.collectorsocialSecurityNumber = Collector.socialSecurityNumber AND collectorsocialSecurityNumber  IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY Collector.lastName, Collector.firstName;

--4.	For each potential buyer, find information about shows that feature his or her preferred artist. 

SELECT firstName, lastName, showTitle, showOpeningDate, showClosingDate
FROM Show, PotentialCustomer
WHERE showFeaturedArtistId = PotentialCustomer.preferredArtistId
ORDER BY potentialCustomerId;

--5.	Find the average sale price of works of artist Georgia Keefe.

FROM Sale
WHERE artworkId IN (SELECT artworkId
			FROM Artwork
			WHERE artistId = (SELECT ArtistId
